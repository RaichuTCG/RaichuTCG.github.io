    <h2>Main Strategy</h2>
    <p>Most Lost Box decks (Lost Zone decks) make use of cards such as the <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/comfey-lost-origin-lor-079/" target="_blank">Comfey</a>, <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/sableye-lost-origin-lor-070/" target="_blank">Sableye</a>, and <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/cramorant-lost-origin-lor-050/" target="_blank">Cramorant</a> pictured above. Why? Because with the return of the Lost Zone mechanic with Sword and Shield: Lost Origin, cards such as Comfey can put cards into your Lost Zone. Then, cards such as Cramorant and Sableye get boosts from having a certain number of cards in the Lost Zone. Most of the time, after setting up your Lost Zone with enough cards, you can make use of cards that will help you take easy KOs.</p>
    <h2>Key Cards</h2>
    <p>Lost Box decks utilize a multitude of different cards but the most common are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/comfey-lost-origin-lor-079/" target="_blank">Comfey</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/sableye-lost-origin-lor-070/" target="_blank">Sableye</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/cramorant-lost-origin-lor-050/" target="_blank">Cramorant</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/radiant-greninja-astral-radiance-asr-046/" target="_blank">Radiant Greninja</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/colresss-experiment-lost-origin-lor-155/" target="_blank">Colress's Experiment</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/mirage-gate-lost-origin-lor-163/" target="_blank">Mirage Gate</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/battle-vip-pass-fusion-strike-fst-225/" target="_blank">Battle VIP Pass</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Attackers</h2>
    <p>Lost Box decks always utilize different attackers:</p>
    <h4><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/dragonite-v-sword-shield-promos-swsh154/" target="_blank">Dragonite V</a></h4>
    <p>Dragonite V is one of the strongest Pokemon V from Sword and Shield, and for a good reason too. Its <i>Dragon Gale</i> Attack does a massive 250 damage but also does 20 damage to each of your Benched Pokemon. However, this can be used to take out big Pokemon such as opposing VStar, VMax, V, or ex Pokemon. Be careful with the recoil damage as you can put your Pokemon into easy KO range for your opponent. Normally, Dragonite V is charged up with Mirage Gate after you have at least seven cards in your Lost Zone. Dragonite is a main attacker for many Lost Box decks too.</p>
    <h4><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/radiant-charizard-crown-zenith-crz-020/" target="_blank">Radiant Charizard</a></h4>
    <p>Radiant Charizard is a great late game sweeper for Lost Box decks. Charizard's <i>Excited Heart</i> Ability makes Charizard's attack cost cheaper by one energy for every Prize Card your opponent has taken. This works in synergy with Charizard's only Attack - <i>Combustion Blast</i>. For one fire energy and four colorless energy for a big 250 damage, Charizard is a really powerful Pokemon when your opponent has already knocked out some of your Pokemon. Sure, it can't attack next turn but utilizing the many switching cards Lost Box decks run, you can easily get consistent KOs against your opponent's Pokemon.</p>
    <h4><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/drapion-v-lost-origin-lor-118/" target="_blank">Drapion V</a></h4>
    <p>Drapion V is often dubbed the <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/mew-vmax-fusion-strike-fst-114/" target="_blank">Mew</a> killer, and for a good reason too. Drapion V is dark type Pokemon with 210HP. Its <i>Wild Style</i> Ability makes beating up <a href="raichutcg.github.io/deck-archetypes/mew-vmax-2023-2024/" target="_blank">Mew VMax decks</a> super easy. Drapion is a staple inclusion in many meta decks and finds itself in a big majority of Lost Box decks too.</p>
    <h4><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/raikou-v-brilliant-stars-brs-048/" target="_blank">Raikou V</a></h4>
    <p>Raikou V makes an excellent addition to Lost Box decks, providing lightning type coverage. It allows you to draw an extra card each turn if it's your Active Pokmon via its <i>Fleet-Footed</i> Ability. Its only attack - <i>Lightning Rondo</i> - it also decent against other decks that fill up their bench. Other than that, Raikou V makes a great pivot too, needing only one colorless energy to retreat.</p>
    <h4><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/hisuian-goodra-vstar-lost-origin-lor-136/" target="_blank">Hisuian Goodra VStar</a></h4>
    <p>Hisuian Goodra VStar makes up its own little deck, using the Lost Zone engine to charge itself up with cards like Mirage Gate. Its <i>Rolling Iron</i> Attack reduces damage next turn to Goodra by 80, making it very powerful. Its VStar Power comes in the form of its <i>Moisture Star</i> Ability that lets you heal all damage from Goodra once per game. This gives Goodra great survivability and makes it a foe to be reckoned with.</p>
    <h4><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/giratina-vstar-lost-origin-lor-131/" target="_blank">Giratina VStar</a></h4>
    <p>Giratina VStar is its own deck archetype which you can read about <a href="https://raichutcg.github.io/deck-archetypes/losttina-2023-2024/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <h4><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/zamazenta-crown-zenith-crz-097/" target="_blank">Zamazenta</a></h4>
    <p>The single-prize Zamazenta from Sword and Shield: Crown Zenith is sometimes used with Lost Box decks having a similar use to Radiant Charizard as a late-game sweeper.</p>
    <h4><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/snorlax-lost-origin-lor-143/" target="_blank">Snorlax</a></h4>
    <p>Snorlax makes a great single-prize attacker for decks such as Lost Box. It does 180 damage for three colorless energy but falls asleep after it attacks. However, you can switch out your active Snorlax for other backup attackers to take consistent KOs during the game.</p>
    <h4><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/kyogre-celebrations-cel-003/" targte="_blank">Kyogre</a></h4>
    <p>Kyogre from the Celebrations set is sometimes used as a single-prize attacker with Lost Box. Kyogre's <i>Aqua Storm</i> Attack is super powerful in the sense that it can take multi-prize KOs in one turn. It can be manually charged up and used late game to clean up the board after you use Sableye to spread damage onto your opponent's Pokemon.</p>
    <h4><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/galarian-moltres-evolving-skies-evs-093/" target="_blank">Galarian Moltres</a></h4>
    <p>Galarian Moltres is used similarily to the other single-prize attackers in Lost Box. It can be a main attacker or a single-prize version of Drapion V.</p>
    <h2>Different Variants/Builds</h2>
    <p>There are currently <b>five</b> main variants of Lost Box active in the current meta (as of early September 2023):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Turbo Lost Box</b> - This variant aims to make use of Mirage Gate as early as possible, using Comfey and Colress's Experiment to get seven cards in the Lost Zone as early as turn two. Then, charge up attackers such as Raikou V, Drapion V, and Dragonite V to take KOs on your opponent's Pokemon as early as possible to win the game.</li>
        <li><b>Sablezard</b> - Another popular and consistent deck that makes good use of the Lost Zone mechanic and uses Sableye and Radiant Charizard as its main attackers. Cramorant is used, like in all Lost Box decks, in the first few turns to take early KOs.</li>
        <li><b>Lost Box Giratina (LostTina)</b> - A successful variant of Lost Box that uses Giratina VStar (read about it <a href="https://raichutcg.github.io/deck-archetypes/losttina-2023-2024/" target="_blank">here</a>)</li>
        <li><b>Lost Box Goodra</b> - This variant aims to make a near unkillable Goodra that can KO your opponents Pokemon consistently. Zamazenta and Drapion V are sometimes used as backup attackers against different decks.</li>
        <li><b>Single-Prize Lost Box</b> - The last variant of Lost Box: it uses only single-prize attackers like Zamazenta, Galarian Moltres, Kyogre, or Snorlax to take KOs against multi-prize Pokemon. This deck has incredible prize trade, using powerful single-prize attackers and synergy with the Lost Zone engine.</li>
