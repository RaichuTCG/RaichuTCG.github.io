    <h1>Lost Box</h1>
    <p>Lost Box and its variants is a deck archetype currently being played in the 2023-2024 format and was played in the 2022-2023 format. This deck revolves around the <i>Lost Zone</i> mechanic that returned in Sword and Shield: Lost Origin.

    <h2>Main Strategy</h2>
    <p>Most Lost Box decks (Lost Zone decks) make use of cards such as the <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/comfey-lost-origin-lor-079/" target="_blank">Comfey</a>, <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/sableye-lost-origin-lor-070/" target="_blank">Sableye</a>, and <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/cramorant-lost-origin-lor-050/" target="_blank">Cramorant</a> pictured above. Why? Because with the return of the Lost Zone mechanic with Sword and Shield: Lost Origin, cards such as Comfey can put cards into your Lost Zone. Then, cards such as Cramorant and Sableye get boosts from having a certain number of cards in the Lost Zone. Most of the time, after setting up your Lost Zone with enough cards, you can make use of cards that will help you take easy KOs.</p>
    <h2>Key Cards</h2>
    <p>Lost Box decks utilize a multitude of different cards but the most common are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/comfey-lost-origin-lor-079/" target="_blank">Comfey</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/sableye-lost-origin-lor-070/" target="_blank">Sableye</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/cramorant-lost-origin-lor-050/" target="_blank">Cramorant</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/radiant-greninja-astral-radiance-asr-046/" target="_blank">Radiant Greninja</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/colresss-experiment-lost-origin-lor-155/" target="_blank">Colress's Experiment</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/mirage-gate-lost-origin-lor-163/" target="_blank">Mirage Gate</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/battle-vip-pass-fusion-strike-fst-225/" target="_blank">Battle VIP Pass</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Attackers</h2>
    <p>Lost Box decks always utilize different attackers,</p>
    <h2>Different Variants/Builds</h2>
    <p>As of early September 2023, there are two main variants of Chien-Pao decks.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/arceus-vstar-brilliant-stars-brs-123/" target="_blank">Arceus VStar</a> builds</li>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/origin-forme-palkia-vstar-astral-radiance-asr-040/" target="_blank">Palkia VStar</a> builds</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Both variants have seen widespread play but can be easily categorized:</p>
    <p>Arceus variants are usually used for Arceus's <i>Starbirth</i> VStar Ability that lets you search your deck for any two cards you want once per game. This allows for more consistent plays by letting you take big knockouts early game or by finding a card like a draw supporter or stadium to help you get out of sticky situations.</p>
    <p>Similarily, Palkia decks use Palkia VStar instead of Arceus. Palkia's <i>Subspace Swell</i> is a great attack, being able to swing for only two water energies. Its VStar power also lets you recycle basic water energy directly back onto Chien-Pao. Obviously, you wouldn't attack with Arceus VStar if you were playing an Arceus variant of Chien-Pao.</p>
    <h2>Sample Decklists</h2>

    </ul>
    <h2>Possible Tech Options</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Professor's Research - It's already a staple in many decks but isn't normally run with Chien-Pao ex decks. However, a few copies can be usable as quick draw support to recover from hand disruption cards.</li>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/bibarel-brilliant-stars-brs-121/" target="_blank">Bibarel</a> - Bibarel is pretty common among Chien-Pao decks, being a great draw support: it lets you draw cards until you have five cards in your hand once per turn. The only really draw support Pokemon Chien-Pao runs is Radiant Greninja which can be lacking in some cases so Bibarel is a great addition to a Chien-Pao deck with either a 1-1 or 2-2 line of <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/bidoof-crown-zenith-crz-111/" target="_blank">Bidoof</a> and Bibarel.</li>
    </ul>
