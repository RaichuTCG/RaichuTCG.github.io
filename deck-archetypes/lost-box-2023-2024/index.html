    <h1>Lost Box</h1>
    <p>Lost Box and its variants is a deck archetype currently being played in the 2023-2024 format and was played in the 2022-2023 format. This deck revolves around the <i>Lost Zone</i> mechanic that returned in Sword and Shield: Lost Origin. Since its release, it has won numerous events and tournaments and is debatebly the most popular deck in the current meta. The Lost Box toolbox is a great engine that you can use in many ways.</p>

    <h2>Main Strategy</h2>
    <p>Most Lost Box decks (Lost Zone decks) make use of cards such as the <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/comfey-lost-origin-lor-079/" target="_blank">Comfey</a>, <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/sableye-lost-origin-lor-070/" target="_blank">Sableye</a>, and <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/cramorant-lost-origin-lor-050/" target="_blank">Cramorant</a> pictured above. Why? Because with the return of the Lost Zone mechanic with Sword and Shield: Lost Origin, cards such as Comfey can put cards into your Lost Zone. Then, cards such as Cramorant and Sableye get boosts from having a certain number of cards in the Lost Zone. Most of the time, after setting up your Lost Zone with enough cards, you can make use of cards that will help you take easy KOs.</p>
    <h2>Key Cards</h2>
    <p>Lost Box decks utilize a multitude of different cards but the most common are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/comfey-lost-origin-lor-079/" target="_blank">Comfey</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/sableye-lost-origin-lor-070/" target="_blank">Sableye</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/cramorant-lost-origin-lor-050/" target="_blank">Cramorant</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/radiant-greninja-astral-radiance-asr-046/" target="_blank">Radiant Greninja</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/colresss-experiment-lost-origin-lor-155/" target="_blank">Colress's Experiment</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/mirage-gate-lost-origin-lor-163/" target="_blank">Mirage Gate</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/battle-vip-pass-fusion-strike-fst-225/" target="_blank">Battle VIP Pass</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Attackers</h2>
    <p>Lost Box decks always utilize different attackers:</p>
    <h4><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/dragonite-v-sword-shield-promos-swsh154/" target="_blank">Dragonite V</a></h4>
    <p>Dragonite V is one of the strongest Pokemon V from Sword and Shield, and for a good reason too. Its <i>Dragon Gale</i> Attack does a massive 250 damage but also does 20 damage to each of your Benched Pokemon. However, this can be used to take out big Pokemon such as opposing VStar, VMax, V, or ex Pokemon. Be careful with the recoil damage as you can put your Pokemon into easy KO range for your opponent. Normally, Dragonite V is charged up with Mirage Gate after you have at least seven cards in your Lost Zone. Dragonite is a main attacker for many Lost Box decks too.</p>
    <h4><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/radiant-charizard-crown-zenith-crz-020/" target="_blank">Radiant Charizard</a></h4>
    <p>Radiant Charizard is a great late game sweeper for Lost Box decks. Charizard's <i>Excited Heart</i> Ability makes Charizard's attack cost cheaper by one energy for every Prize Card your opponent has taken. This works in synergy with Charizard's only Attack - <i>Combustion Blast</i>. For one fire energy and four colorless energy for a big 250 damage, Charizard is a really powerful Pokemon when your opponent has already knocked out some of your Pokemon. Sure, it can't attack next turn but utilizing the many switching cards Lost Box decks run, you can easily get consistent KOs against your opponent's Pokemon.</p>
    <h4><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/drapion-v-lost-origin-lor-118/" target="_blank">Drapion V</a></h4>
    <p>Drapion V is often dubbed the <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/mew-vmax-fusion-strike-fst-114/" target="_blank">Mew</a> killer, and for a good reason too. Drapion V is dark type Pokemon with 210HP. Its <i>Wild Style</i> Ability makes beating up <a href="raichutcg.github.io/deck-archetypes/mew-vmax-2023-2024/" target="_blank">Mew VMax decks</a> super easy. Drapion is a staple inclusion in many meta decks and finds itself in a big majority of Lost Box decks too.</p>
    <h4><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/hisuian-goodra-vstar-lost-origin-lor-136/" target="_blank">Hisuian Goodra VStar</a></h4>
    <p>Hisuian Goodra VStar makes up its own little deck, using the Lost Zone engine to charge itself up with cards like Mirage Gate. Its <i>Rolling Iron</i> Attack reduces damage next turn to Goodra by 80, making it very powerful. Its VStar Power comes in the form of its <i>Moisture Star</i> Ability that lets you heal all damage from Goodra once per game. This gives Goodra great survivability and makes it a foe to be reckoned with.</p>
    <h4><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/giratina-vstar-lost-origin-lor-131/" target="_blank">Giratina VStar</a></h4>
    <p>Giratina VStar is its own deck archetype which you can read about <a href="https://raichutcg.github.io/deck-archetypes/losttina-2023-2024/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <h4><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/zamazenta-crown-zenith-crz-097/" target="_blank">Zamazenta</a></h4>
    <p>The single-prize Zamazenta from Sword and Shield: Crown Zenith is sometimes used with Lost Box decks having a similar use to Radiant Charizard as a late-game sweeper.</p>
    <h4><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/snorlax-lost-origin-lor-143/" target="_blank">Snorlax</a></h4>
    <p>Snorlax makes a great single-prize attacker for decks such as Lost Box. It does 180 damage for three colorless energy but falls asleep after it attacks. However, you can switch out your active Snorlax for other backup attackers to take consistent KOs during the game.</p>
    <h4><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/kyogre-celebrations-cel-003/" targte="_blank">Kyogre</a></h4>
    <p>Kyogre from the Celebrations set is sometimes used as a single-prize attacker with Lost Box. Kyogre's <i>Aqua Storm</i> Attack is super powerful in the sense that it can take multi-prize KOs in one turn. It can be manually charged up and used late game to clean up the board after you use Sableye to spread damage onto your opponent's Pokemon.</p>
    <h2>Different Variants/Builds</h2>
    <p>As of early September 2023, there are two main variants of Chien-Pao decks.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/arceus-vstar-brilliant-stars-brs-123/" target="_blank">Arceus VStar</a> builds</li>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/origin-forme-palkia-vstar-astral-radiance-asr-040/" target="_blank">Palkia VStar</a> builds</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Both variants have seen widespread play but can be easily categorized:</p>
    <p>Arceus variants are usually used for Arceus's <i>Starbirth</i> VStar Ability that lets you search your deck for any two cards you want once per game. This allows for more consistent plays by letting you take big knockouts early game or by finding a card like a draw supporter or stadium to help you get out of sticky situations.</p>
    <p>Similarily, Palkia decks use Palkia VStar instead of Arceus. Palkia's <i>Subspace Swell</i> is a great attack, being able to swing for only two water energies. Its VStar power also lets you recycle basic water energy directly back onto Chien-Pao. Obviously, you wouldn't attack with Arceus VStar if you were playing an Arceus variant of Chien-Pao.</p>
    <h2>Sample Decklists</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://limitlesstcg.com/decks/list/8199" target="_blank">Hui Yuan Huang's 13th Place 2023 World Championships decklist - featuring Palkia VStar</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://limitlesstcg.com/decks/list/7992" target="_blank">Owen Rhoads's 12th Place 2023 NAIC  - featuring Arceus VStar</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Possible Tech Options</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Professor's Research - It's already a staple in many decks but isn't normally run with Chien-Pao ex decks. However, a few copies can be usable as quick draw support to recover from hand disruption cards.</li>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/bibarel-brilliant-stars-brs-121/" target="_blank">Bibarel</a> - Bibarel is pretty common among Chien-Pao decks, being a great draw support: it lets you draw cards until you have five cards in your hand once per turn. The only really draw support Pokemon Chien-Pao runs is Radiant Greninja which can be lacking in some cases so Bibarel is a great addition to a Chien-Pao deck with either a 1-1 or 2-2 line of <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/bidoof-crown-zenith-crz-111/" target="_blank">Bidoof</a> and Bibarel.</li>
    </ul>
