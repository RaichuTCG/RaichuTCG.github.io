    <h1>Chien-Pao</h1>
    <p>Chien-Pao ex is a deck currently being played in the 2023-2024 format. This deck revolves around <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/chien-pao-ex-paldea-evolved-pal-061/" target="_blank">Chien-Pao ex</a> from Scarlet and Violet: Paldea Evolved.</p>
    <img src="https://i0.wp.com/pkmncards.com/wp-content/uploads/sv2_en_061.jpg?fit=734%2C1024&ssl=1" alt="Chien-Pao ex" class="pkmncards">
    <h2>Main Strategy</h2>
    <p>Chien-Pao's Ability <i>Shivery Chill</i> help you search your deck for two basic water energies each turn, provided Chien-Pao is your active Pokemon. Then, using <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/baxcalibur-paldea-evolved-pal-060/" target="_blank">Baxcalibur</a> to quickly accelerate energy onto your Pokemon, use Chien-Pao's <i>Hail Blade</i> Attack to take quick OHKOs on your opponents Pokemon. Then, use <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/radiant-greninja-astral-radiance-asr-046/" target="_blank">Radiant Greninja</a> to draw cards while recycling discarded energy cards with <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/superior-energy-retrieval-paldea-evolved-pal-189/" target="_blank">Superior Energy Retrieval</a>.</p>
    <h2>Different Variants/Builds</h2>
    <p>As of early September 2023, there are two main variants of Chien-Pao decks.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/arceus-vstar-brilliant-stars-brs-123/" target="_blank">Arceus VStar</a> builds</li>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/origin-forme-palkia-vstar-astral-radiance-asr-040/" target="_blank">Palkia VStar</a> builds</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Both variants have seen widespread play but can be easily categorized:</p>
    <p>Arceus variants are usually used for Arceus's <i>Starbirth</i> VStar Ability that lets you search your deck for any two cards you want once per game. This allows for more consistent plays by letting you take big knockouts early game or by finding a card like a draw supporter or stadium to help you get out of sticky situations.</p>
    <p>Similarily, Palkia decks use Palkia VStar instead of Arceus. Palkia's <i>Subspace Swell</i> is a great attack, being able to swing for only two water energies. Its VStar power also lets you recycle basic water energy directly back onto Chien-Pao. Obviously, you wouldn't attack with Arceus VStar if you were playing an Arceus variant of Chien-Pao.</p>

    <h2>Possible Tech Options</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Professor's Research - It's already a staple in many decks but isn't normally run with Chien-Pao ex decks. However, a few copies can be usable as quick draw support to recover from hand disruption cards.</li>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/bibarel-brilliant-stars-brs-121/" target="_blank">Bibarel</a> - Bibarel is pretty common among Chien-Pao decks, being a great draw support: it lets you draw cards until you have five cards in your hand once per turn.</li>
    </ul>
