    <h1>Chien-Pao</h1>
    <p>Chien-Pao ex is a deck currently being played in the 2023-2024 format. This deck revolves around <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/chien-pao-ex-paldea-evolved-pal-061/" target="_blank">Chien-Pao ex</a> from Scarlet and Violet: Paldea Evolved.</p>
    <img src="https://i0.wp.com/pkmncards.com/wp-content/uploads/sv2_en_061.jpg?fit=734%2C1024&ssl=1" alt="Chien-Pao ex" class="pkmncards">
    <h2>Main Strategy</h2>
    <p>Chien-Pao's Ability <i>Shivery Chill</i> help you search your deck for two basic water energies each turn, provided Chien-Pao is your active Pokemon. Then, using <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/baxcalibur-paldea-evolved-pal-060/" target="_blank">Baxcalibur</a> to quickly accelerate energy onto your Pokemon, use Chien-Pao's <i>Hail Blade</i> Attack to take quick OHKOs on your opponents Pokemon. Then, use <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/radiant-greninja-astral-radiance-asr-046/" target="_blank">Radiant Greninja</a> to draw cards while recycling discarded energy cards with <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/superior-energy-retrieval-paldea-evolved-pal-189/" target="_blank">Superior Energy Retrieval</a>.</p>
    <h2>Different Variants/Builds</h2>
    <p>As of early September 2023, there are two main variants of Chien-Pao decks.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/arceus-vstar-brilliant-stars-brs-123/" target="_blank">Arceus VStar</a> builds</li>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/origin-forme-palkia-vstar-astral-radiance-asr-040/" target="_blank">Palkia VStar</a> builds</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Noticeably, both Andrew Mahone and Sejun Park ran a Flaaffy variant, using <i>Dynamotor</i> to power up attackers quickly, resulting in a more turbo build. These variants aim to take quick turn two knock outs, letting Raichu V and Raikou V do the heavy-lifting. Miraidon ex itself also attacks but is used early-game for its ability.</p>
    <p>In contrast, Gabor Van Meenen used a different build of Miraidon using <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/regieleki-vmax-silver-tempest-sit-058/" target="_blank">Regieleki VMax</a> instead of Flaaffy. Regieleki's <i>Transistor</i> Ability boosts the damage output of basic lightning type Pokemon. This variant uses Miraidon ex for attacking and doesn't run any other attackers other than Raikou V that Flaaffy variants use. It also relies more on <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/electric-generator-scarlet-violet-svi-170/" target="_blank">Electric Generator</a> for accelerating energy onto your Pokemon.</p>
    <h2>Sample Decklists</h2>
    <p>Refer to above World Championships decklists.</p>
    <h2>Possible Tech Options</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/radiant-greninja-astral-radiance-asr-046/" target="_blank">Radiant Greninja</a> - It's already a staple in many decks but finds itself in a unique position with Miraidon Flaaffy decks. Using <i>Concealed Cards</i>, you can discard an energy to draw two cards. This fits perfectly with Flaaffy and lets you accelerate energy onto your Pokemon while being able to draw some extra cards for consistency.</li>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/klefki-scarlet-violet-svi-096/" target="_blank">Klefki</a> - This card is a unique tech option for countering the current meta. Its <i>Mischievous Lock</i> Ability helps deal with decks such as Mew VMax by disabling their <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/genesect-v-fusion-strike-fst-185/" target="_blank">Genesects</a> and against <a href="https://raichutcg.github.io/deck-archetypes/lost-box-2023-2024/" target="_blank">Lost Zone decks</a> by disabling their <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/comfey-lost-origin-lor-079/" target="_blank">Comfeys</a>, <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/cramorant-lost-origin-lor-050/" target="_blank">Cramorants</a>, and some of their attackers.</li>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/forest-seal-stone-silver-tempest-sit-156/" target="_blank">Forest Seal Stone</a> - Since Miraidon ex doesn't run any VStar Pokemon, running Forest Seal stone makes use of the VStar mechanic and improves the consistency of the deck by letting you search your deck for any card you want once per game. Being able to attach it to a Raikou V, Raichu V, or Regieleki VMax allows for flexible options too.</li>
