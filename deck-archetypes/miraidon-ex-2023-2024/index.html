    <h2>Main Strategy</h2>
    <p>Making use of Miraidon ex's <i>Tandem Unit</i> that lets you search your deck for two basic lightning type pokemon and putting them onto your bench. This lets you find cards such as Mareeps to evolve into <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/flaaffy-evolving-skies-evs-055/" target="_blank">Flaffys</a> and attackers such as <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/raikou-v-brilliant-stars-brs-048/" target="_blank">Raikou V</a>, <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/raichu-v-brilliant-stars-brs-045/" target="_blank">Raichu V</a>, and other Miraidon ex. Miraidon ex itself is also a great attacker, being able to hit 220 for two lightning energy and a colorless energy. Raikou V is a quick and easy pivot, needing only one energy to retreat. Raikou's <i>Fleet-Footed</i> Ability also allows you a quick draw one each turn with Raikou in the active. Other than that, <i>Lightning Rondo</i> is a great and cheap attack, being a great attack to use in the first few turns of a game.</p>
