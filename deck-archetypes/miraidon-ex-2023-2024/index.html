    <h1>Miraidon ex</h1>
    <p>Miraidon ex is a deck currently being played in the 2023-2024 format. This deck revolves around <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/miraidon-ex-scarlet-violet-svi-081/" target="_blank">Miraidon ex</a> from Scarlet and Violet Base Set.</p>
    <img src="https://i0.wp.com/pkmncards.com/wp-content/uploads/sv1_en_081-1.jpg?fit=734%2C1024&ssl=1" alt="Miraidon ex" class="pkmncards">
    <h2>Main Strategy</h2>
    <p>Making use of Miraidon ex's <i>Tandem Unit</i> that lets you search your deck for two basic lightning type pokemon and putting them onto your bench. This lets you find cards such as Mareeps to evolve into <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/flaaffy-evolving-skies-evs-055/" target="_blank">Flaffys</a> and attackers such as <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/raikou-v-brilliant-stars-brs-048/" target="_blank">Raikou V</a>, <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/raichu-v-brilliant-stars-brs-045/" target="_blank">Raichu V</a>, and other Miraidon ex. Miraidon ex itself is also a great attacker, being able to hit 220 for two lightning energy and a colorless energy. Raikou V is a quick and easy pivot, needing only one energy to retreat. Raikou's <i>Fleet-Footed</i> Ability also allows you a quick draw one each turn with Raikou in the active. Other than that, <i>Lightning Rondo</i> is a great and cheap attack, being a great attack to use in the first few turns of a game.</p>
    <h2>Different Variants/Builds</h2>
    <p>Recently, at the 2023 World Championships, we saw three <b>Top 64</b> Miraidon decks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://limitlesstcg.com/decks/list/8186" target="_blank">Andrew Mahone's 21st Place Deck</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://limitlesstcg.com/decks/list/8197" target="_blank">Sejun Park's 30th Place Deck</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://limitlesstcg.com/decks/list/8211" target="_blank">Gabor Van Meenen's 39th Place Deck</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Noticeably, both Andrew Mahone and Sejun Park ran a Flaaffy variant, using <i>Dynamotor</i> to power up attackers quickly, resulting in a more turbo build. These variants aim to take quick turn two knock outs, letting Raichu V and Raikou V do the heavy-lifting. Miraidon ex itself also attacks but is used early-game for its ability.</p>
    <p>In contrast, Gabor Van Meenen used a different build of Miraidon using <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/regieleki-vmax-silver-tempest-sit-058/" target="_blank">Regieleki VMax</a> instead of Flaaffy. Regieleki's <i>Transistor</i> Ability boosts the damage output of basic lightning type Pokemon. This variant uses Miraidon ex for attacking and doesn't run any other attackers other than Raikou V that Flaaffy variants use. It also relies more on <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/electric-generator-scarlet-violet-svi-170/" target="_blank">Electric Generator</a> for accelerating energy onto your Pokemon.</p>
    <h2>Sample Decklists</h2>
    <p>Refer to above World Championships decklists.</p>
    <h2>Possible Tech Options</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/radiant-greninja-astral-radiance-asr-046/" target="_blank">Radiant Greninja</a> - It's already a staple in many decks but finds itself in a unique position with Miraidon Flaaffy decks. Using <i>Concealed Cards</i>, you can discard an energy to draw two cards. This fits perfectly with Flaaffy and lets you accelerate energy onto your Pokemon while being able to draw some extra cards for consistency.</li>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/klefki-scarlet-violet-svi-096/" target="_blank">Klefki</a> - This card is a unique tech option for countering the current meta. Its <i>Mischievous Lock</i> Ability helps deal with decks such as Mew VMax by disabling their <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/genesect-v-fusion-strike-fst-185/" target="_blank">Genesects</a> and against <a href="https://raichutcg.github.io/deck-archetypes/lost-box-2023-2024/" target="_blank">Lost Zone decks</a> by disabling their <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/comfey-lost-origin-lor-079/" target="_blank">Comfeys</a>, <a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/cramorant-lost-origin-lor-050/" target="_blank">Cramorants</a>, and some of their attackers.</li>
        <li><a href="https://pkmncards.com/card/forest-seal-stone-silver-tempest-sit-156/" target="_blank">Forest Seal Stone</a> - Since Miraidon ex doesn't run any VStar cards, running Forest Seal stone makes use of the VStar mechanic and improves the consistency of the deck by letting you search your deck for any card you want once per game. Being able to attach it to a Raikou V, Raichu V, or Regieleki VMax allows for flexible options too.</li>
